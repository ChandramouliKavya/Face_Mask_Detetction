# ðŸ˜· Face Mask Detection App

Due to global health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, public health regulations often mandate wearing face masks in public spaces to reduce disease transmission. However, manual monitoring of mask compliance in crowded areas like airports, malls, offices, and schools is inefficient and costly.

Organizations need an automated solution to detect whether individuals are wearing masks properly to ensure safety compliance and avoid potential health risks or penalties.
